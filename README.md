ylang must be able to implement these algorithms:
* Convolution
* Median
* Canny edge detection

* Hough transform
* Color distribution

## Roadmap
* Web interface with monaco as editor
* Drawing language for creation of graphical images
* Compile to intermediate language -> ByteCode
* Use WASM? JavaScript first :)
